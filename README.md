# Lemonade
A todo-app that allows you to create, delete, edit, & store tasks, set due dates, pin priority items, add subtasks & notes, categorize tasks with custom, color-coded tags, create new lists & organize them into folders, and filter tasks by completion status, due date, tags, & keywords

## Version 2

Goals:
* improve state management by implementing flux architecture with Pub/Sub pattern and unidirectional data flow
* boost performance and overall functionality by refactoring JS, implementing unit testing via Jest and js benchmarking tools, and applying knowledge of big O complexities and data structures (ex. restructure state data using a hash table instead of array)
* extend scalability through modularization, functional programming, writing cleaner, more concise code (DRY)

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Vanilla JS (no framework)
